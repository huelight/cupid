          <p>My dearest Oluwafolakemi,</p>

          <p>
            As we approach this special day of love, 
            I can't help but think about all the amazing memories we've shared together. 
          </p>

          <p> 
          You have brought so much joy and happiness into my life and I feel incredibly lucky to have you by my side.
          Would you be my girlfriend and continue this journey with me?
          </p>
          
          <p>
          Yours always,
          <br></br>
          Olumide</p>

          <h3>I'm Always Yours</h3>
          <p>Roses are red, violets are blue,<br></br>
            I never knew love until I met you.<br></br>
            Your smile lights up my day,<br></br>
            Every moment with you is a holiday.
          </p>
          <p>
            So on this Valentine's Day, I want to say,<br></br>
            How much I love you and always will,<br></br>
            You are my everything, my world, my way,<br></br>
            And I can't imagine life without you still.
